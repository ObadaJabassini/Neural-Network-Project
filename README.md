# Neural-Network-Project
A university project to implement some basic neural network algorithms like : 
* Simple perceptron
* Backpropagation
* Backpropagation with momentum
* etc...

## TODO:
* Add More Algorithms
* Parallelize the code
* Add Visualization(partially done)

## This project is still in very early stage(most of the planned features don't even exist)

## Members:

* Amal Alnouri
* Baraa Salhany
* Obada Jabassini
* Raodah Sandouk
