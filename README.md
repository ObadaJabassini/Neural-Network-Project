# Neural-Network-Project
A university project to implement some basic neural network algorithms like : 
* Simple perceptron
* Backpropagation(Done)
* Backpropagation with momentum(Done)
* Newtom Algorithm(In-progress)
* Levenberge Algorithm(Testing phase)
* Associative memory(soon)
* etc...

## TODO:
* Parallelize the code
* Add Visualization(almost done)
* Imporve UI/UX

## This project is still in early stage(most of the planned features aren't tested or ready yet)

## Members:

* Amal Alnouri
* Baraa Salhany
* Obada Jabassini
